         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Dr. Sherlock Vindicated, OR, COGENT REASONS, Why that Worthy Perſon hath complied with the Neceſſity of the Times, and why he at firſt refuſed it.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MEN of that Learning and Senſe, as the Gentleman we ſpeak of, are not ſuppoſed to act without Ground, nor without more than ordinary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for things of ſo extraordinary a Nature; ſome of which Reaſons, among others, may be aſſigned for his refuſing to Comply with the Act of Parliament, and Swearing to the Preſent Government as followeth:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>I. The Clergy had a great Intereſt, and no ſmall hopes in the Parliament, that they ſhould be excuſed in the Act, and after, that their Credit and Word might be taken for their fidelity to the King, only on the Reputation of their Sanctity and Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion: Though at the ſame time, they would not take the King and Queens Word, without an Oath to uphold all their Pontifical Splendor.</item>
                  <item>II. They thought to poſſeſs the People with ſuch an opinion of their Conſtancy and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in a matter of Conſcience, as to gain the Reputation of the Martyrs of the Church, and ſo make themſelves Popular, as a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 chunk">
                        <desc>…</desc>
                     </gap>ing might be very uſeful to them in Caſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revolution.</item>
                  <item>III. They were working to poſſeſs the King too, with the Conſiderableneſs of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Intereſt in the Nation, that he ſhould not venture to deprive them according to the Act, for fear of diſobliging the People.</item>
                  <item>IV. They had a great many Cards to play yet for a new turn, and that Luſtre of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for an untainted Zeal to the Intereſt of a Popiſh King, made it neceſſary to ſtand Neuter as long as poſſible.</item>
                  <item>V. They were very loth to Manacle their Endeavours with the Fetters of an Oath, that they might act for a Reſtoration, without the Clog of Perjury.</item>
                  <item>VI. They had yet great Reaſon to think, their Intereſt ſtrong enough at worſt, to gain the Grant of their Sallaries to them, though they were deprived, which would render their great Suffering a little comfortable.</item>
                  <item>VII. At laſt, if all their Expectations were fruſtrate, there was no Incapacitating Clauſe in the Act, it was but ſwearing at laſt, and all would be well; again, the Re-admiſſion was the leaſt act of Lenity they could receive.—<hi>Cum multis aliis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Theſe Reaſons Conſidered, what ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations does the Preſent Juncture offer for the preſent Compliance?</head>
               <p>Why,
<list>
                     <item>I. The Parliament, notwithſtanding all the Intereſt made, has not thought fit to Excuſe them, That wiſe Aſſembly, finding the bounds of an Oath every jot as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſecure the Allegiance of the Clergy, as of other People.</item>
                     <item>II. The People who are oftner convinced by Demonſtration than Pretences, ſaw thro' the Mask ſooner than was expected, and could not believe them to be Martyrs for the Church, who refuſed to pray for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant King, but eſteemed them Hypocrites and Jacobites; ſo one great end of their Suffering, Applauſe, and Popular Pity was loſt.</item>
                     <item>III. As a Conſequence of this, their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure became ſo deſpicable, that they loſt all their Influence on the Court, and were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcorned than feared; and they have found the King not to be awed from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saw to have its Courſe, and Juſtice to proceed without Diſtinction.</item>
                     <item>IV. They have not found that Succeſs on their Prayers and Faſtings as was expected, their Church ſtill groaning under, what they have had the Impudence to call, The Fetters of a cruel Uſurpation.</item>
                     <item>V. Their great Refuge, the Divine, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, Moſt Chriſtian <hi>Grand Seignior, Lewis le Grand,</hi> has not been able to compleat the Endeavours he has made towards their Reſcue, tho' they were not at all wanting in their moſt Chriſtian Endeavour, to call in a Barbarous and Foreign Nation, into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of their Native Country.</item>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37284:2"/>
                     <item> VI. The Fleet more by the providence of God than otherwiſe, has eſcaped betraying, as they had moſt nobly contrived, and is now put into better hands we hope, that we may not be lyable to another French Invaſion: So that Hope is periſhed.</item>
                     <item>VII. King <hi>James,</hi> the other Prop of their Hopes, with all his French Succour, and Iriſh Thouſands, with which he was to Land in <hi>England</hi> every Week, is moſt courageouſly run away; and that Kingdom, no more the Center of their defeated expectation.</item>
                     <item>VIII. Scotch hopes are alſo become like <hi>Jonas</hi>'s Goard, that periſhed in the Morning: And the Thouſands of Hardy Highlanders, are dwindl'd to a few Troops of Banditty, that pray God bleſs King <hi>James,</hi> and God bleſs King <hi>William,</hi> and ſend they may never agree, that we may get good Booty by robbing our Neighbours.</item>
                     <item>IX. And which is worſt of all, King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> whom they well hoped they had ſeen the laſt of, and whom they earneſtly puſht on to go in Perſon into <hi>Ireland,</hi> (with the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intent that <hi>David</hi> ſent <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rias</hi> into the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) is come ſafe home again; Danger hath not prevailed, nor Difficulties overcome, but the Kingdom is in a likely way of recovery.</item>
                     <item>X. Things look on them generally with a bad aſpect as to future hopes, the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> waxes weaker and weaker, and the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſtronger and ſtronger: Poor Abdication is gone, the Lord knows whither, and will return the Lord knows when, and be King again the Lord knows how; Hopes decline, and Endeavours fail, and what can one Tribe do whoſe fingers were never taught to fight, tho' there Prieſt-ridden Hearers have been ſo often ſet together by the Ears, by their Function?</item>
                     <item>XI. The attempt to preach with a <hi>Non Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi> to their Soveraign and an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is but making the Arch-Biſhop Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Revels, to licence what the La<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
